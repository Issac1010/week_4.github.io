**Background:** 

    With industrialization, there is an increasing demand for amphibious robots. The aim of this project is to address the 
    shortcomings of amphibious robots currently on the market, and to design an efficient, economical, and easy-to-maintain 
    amphibious robot for specific environments such as swamps and wetlands.

    Currently there are many researches on amphibious robots, but very few of them can really be put into industrialized 
    production and practicality. Although the snake-shaped amphibious robot is powerful, its mechanical structure is very 
    complicated, and the production cost is very expensive, and it is not easy to repair and maintain, which is not conducive 
    to the promotion of the market. Legged amphibious robots currently have a lot of research, but most of them are 
    restricted to be used in specific environments, this kind of amphibious robots has a strong ability to cross obstacles, 
    but its movement performance in the water is very poor, this fatal disadvantage is also not conducive to its 
    popularization and application in the market. According to the search, most of the current types of underwater robots 
    are concentrated in duck Pu type and crawler type, propeller drive is rare, so this topic is very innovative.

**Robot Features:** 

    Twin screws: provide large contact area to ensure stability and traction in slippery environments.
    
    Autopilot: Based on advanced neural network visual recognition system, it can accurately recognize obstacles and 
    automatically plan the path.
    
    Battery Energy Management System: Adopts high-efficiency and long-life batteries, supporting fast charging and 
    energy-saving modes.

**Detailed Project Plan:** 

    a) Conceptual Design (End: 2023.10.31).
    Conduct market research and define user requirements.
    Develop preliminary design sketches and technical programs.
    Build a small prototype for validation.

    b) Mechanical design (end: 2024.2.29).
    Based on the conceptual design, determine the joints and drive modes.
    Refine the exterior and interior structural design of the robot.
    Conduct simulation tests using finite element analysis software to verify the stability and durability of the design.

    c) Electronic Design (End: 2024.4.15).
    Select appropriate controllers, sensors and actuators.
    Design the main control board and integrate all sensors and actuators.
    Test electronic systems for stability and compatibility.

    d) Software Development (End: 2024.4.15).
    Select or customize operating systems and development frameworks.
    Develop control algorithms, path planning, and visual recognition systems for the robot.
    Design user-friendly interfaces and establish communication protocols with hardware.
    Perform unit testing and fix possible software bugs.

    e) Integration & Testing (Ends: 2024.4.30).
    Integrate mechanical, electronic, and software systems into a complete robot.
    Test in real-world environments, such as swamps, wetlands, etc.
    Debug the performance of the robot to ensure that the design requirements are met.

    f) Subsequent Optimization (End: 2024.5.30).
    Make system adjustments and optimizations based on test results.
    Add more features or improve existing features.
